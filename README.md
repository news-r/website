# news-r

<mark>news-r</mark> is an initiative that attempts to simultaneously promote media scrutiny and freedom of speech.

The project has previously focused on on easing access to data relevant to the aforestated credo, with the integration of APIs that provide data on e.g. [fake news](https://github.com/news-r/hoaxy), [fact checks](https://github.com/news-r/factcheck), or [censorship](https://github.com/news-r/greatfire). The initiative has now brought packages to analyse that data: <mark>news-r</mark> has seen the addition of [gensimr](https://gensimr.news-r.org) for topic modeling and document similarity, [word2vec.r](https://word2vec.news-r.org) an interface to Word2Vec, and [textanalysis](https://textanalysis.news-r.org) for basic text mining and modeling.

The next two items on the list are to unify the both the data collection and analysis, 1) to allow users to _easily_ collect data from the multitude of sources rather than use multiple functions and 2) then also enable users to process that data through a unified API rather than having to understand several interfaces. 

You can explore the open-source software already made available on our [software page](/software).

If you too believe that media scrutiny and freedom of speech---are complimentary---rather than mutually exclusive as often portrayed, please visit our [contributing page](/contributing) to co-operate to submit your project, software, or idea, whatever it might be, we look forward to your reading about it!
